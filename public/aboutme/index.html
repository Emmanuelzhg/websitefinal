                            <h2 id="personal-background">Personal background</h2>
<p>I am 23 years old and grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>A few (fun) facts about myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My birthday is on December 24, which incidentally is the date where Christmas is celebrated in Denmark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am an avid traveler and particularly enjoy trips &ldquo;off the beaten path&rdquo;. For instance I once traveled through Russia, Kazakhstan, and China solely by train</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once had a monkey steal my glasses straight off my face while visiting a temple on Bali</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="educational-background">Educational background</h2>
<p>I studied my undergrad in International Business at <strong>Copenhagen Business School</strong> from 2016 to 2019. As part of the degree, I had two semesters abroad, first at <strong>The Chinese University of Hong Kong</strong> and then at <strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</strong>. They were very different places and definitely motivated me to study abroad for my master&rsquo;s degree and I was lucky enough to get admitted to <strong>London Business School</strong>, where I study right now.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">Work experience</h2>
<p>After graduating from my bachelor&rsquo;s degree, I worked as an analyst for Danish private equity company <strong>Polaris</strong>, which mainly invests in Danish and Swedish companies in the small and mid cap segment. While working for <strong>Polaris</strong> I was involved in two transactions. The first was SSG, which does damage control for insurance companies <a href="http://polarisequity.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Polaris-acquires-SSG.pdf">(read about it here)</a>. The second was Link Logistics, which offers freight forwarding services <a href="http://polarisequity.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Link-English.pdf">(read about it here)</a>.</p>
<p>Before starting my studies at London Business School, I furthermore had an internship at <strong>BCG</strong> where I worked on a VDD for a Danish health care company. This was a very data and analytics heavy project, which I found very fun and interesting. I wish I had known some of the data analytics skills I now possess but alas, perhaps they can be put to good use in future projects.</p>
