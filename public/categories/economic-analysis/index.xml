      <description>Nordic GDP compositionIn this project, we will look at the components of the different Nordic countries and then compare it to the rest of the world. There will be quite a lot of data wrangling, which is really good to know in R. Contrary to excel, it is quite hard to change individual rows in R, which instead primarily works in columns, i.e.Â it is quite easy to subtract one column from another, but a lot harder to subtract one row from another.</description>
