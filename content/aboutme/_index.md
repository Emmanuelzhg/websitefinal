## Personal background 
I am 23 years old and grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark.
I have included a few (fun) facts about me:

* My birthday is on December 24, which incidentally is the date where Christmas is celebrated in Denmark

* I am an avid traveler and particularly enjoy trips "off the beaten path". For instance I once traveled through Russia, Kazakhstan, and China solely by train

* I once had a monkey steal my glasses straight off my face while visiting a temple on Bali

## Educational background
I studied my undergrad in International Business at **Copenhagen Business School** from 2016 to 2019. As part of the degree, I had two semesters abroad, first at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong** and then at **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**. They were very different places and definitely motivated me to study abroad for my master's degree and I was lucky enough to get admitted to **London Business School**, where I study right now.


## Work experience
After graduating from my bachelor's degree, I worked as an analyst for Danish private equity company **Polaris**, which mainly invests in Danish and Swedish companies in the small and mid cap segment. While working for **Polaris** I was involved in two transactions. The first was SSG, which does damage control for insurance companies [(read about it here)](http://polarisequity.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Polaris-acquires-SSG.pdf). The second was Link Logistics, which offers freight forwarding services [(read about it here)](http://polarisequity.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Link-English.pdf).

Before starting my studies at LBS, I furthermore had an internship at **BCG** where I worked on a VDD for a Danish health care company. This was a very data and analytics heavy project, which I found very fun and interesting. I wish I had known some of the data analytics skills I now possess but alas, perhaps they can be put to good use in future projects.
